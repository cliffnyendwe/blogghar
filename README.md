The tags could be added to multiple blogs and a blog could have multiple tags associated with it. User should be able to create, edit and delete the tags.

## Colophon

I did few things for the first time in project. Tried Atom editor (I normally like to stick with subl/pycharm). It is a nice editor, has virtualenv support, nice linter and gutters and other awesome features. I really liked it.

Along with the editor, one major thing I decided to try was django's class based views. I used to stay away from it and stick to fbvs, this is why I decided to write this project using class based views (because where is the fun in doing same thing again and again).

Using class-based-views was a really nice experience. It makes sure that your code is DRY and saves you from repeating same things again and again.
